**Note:** The `download` tool supports an optional `kindle_email` parameter. If not provided, it uses the default `KINDLE_EMAIL` from your `.env` file.

## Requirements

- [A donation to Anna's Archive](https://annas-archive.se/donate), which grants JSON API access
- [An API key](https://annas-archive.se/faq#api)
- Go 1.23+ (if building from source)

For MCP server functionality, you also need an MCP client, such as:
- [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download)
- [Mistral Le Chat](https://lechat.mistral.ai/)

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Build

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd annas-mcp
go build -o annas-mcp ./cmd/annas-mcp
```

### 2. Configure

Create a `.env` file (see `.env.example` for template):

```bash
# Copy the example if it exists, or create manually
cp .env.example .env 2>/dev/null || touch .env
```

Edit `.env` and fill in your values:

```bash
# Required: Anna's Archive API key
ANNAS_SECRET_KEY=your-api-key-here

# Optional: Download path (defaults to temp directory)
ANNAS_DOWNLOAD_PATH=/path/to/downloads

# Optional: Email settings for Kindle (see detailed instructions below)
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-app-password
FROM_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
KINDLE_EMAIL=your-kindle-email@kindle.com
```

### 2.1. Setting Up Kindle Email (Optional)

If you want to email books directly to your Kindle, follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Get a Gmail App Password

1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** on your Google account (required for app passwords):
   - Go to https://myaccount.google.com/security
   - Under "Signing in to Google", click "2-Step Verification"
   - Follow the prompts to enable it

2. **Create an App Password**:
   - Go to https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
   - You may need to sign in again
   - Under "Select app", choose **"Mail"**
   - Under "Select device", choose **"Other (Custom name)"**
   - Enter a name like "Anna's Archive MCP" and click "Generate"
   - **Copy the 16-character password** (it will look like: `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`)
   - This is your `SMTP_PASSWORD` - use it exactly as shown (with or without spaces, both work)

#### Step 2: Find Your Kindle Email Address

1. Go to [Amazon's Manage Your Content and Devices page](https://www.amazon.com/hz/mycd/digital-console/alldevices)
2. Sign in with your Amazon account
3. Click on **"Settings"** (or go to **"Preferences"** → **"Personal Document Settings"**)
4. Scroll down to **"Send-to-Kindle Email Settings"**
5. You'll see your Kindle email address(es) listed (e.g., `yourname_123@kindle.com` or `yourname_123@free.kindle.com`)
6. **Copy this email address** - this is your `KINDLE_EMAIL`

**Note:** If you have multiple Kindles, each will have its own email address. Use the one for the device you want to receive books.

#### Step 3: Whitelist Your Email Address in Kindle Settings

**Important:** Amazon will reject emails from addresses that aren't whitelisted. You must add your sending email to the approved list.

1. On the same **"Personal Document Settings"** page (from Step 2)
2. Scroll to **"Approved Personal Document E-mail List"**
3. Click **"Add a new approved e-mail address"**
4. Enter the email address you'll use to send books (your `FROM_EMAIL` - typically your Gmail address)
5. Click **"Add Address"**
6. You should see a confirmation message

**Note:** It may take a few minutes for the whitelist to take effect. If emails are rejected, wait 5-10 minutes and try again.

#### Step 4: Update Your `.env` File

After completing the above steps, update your `.env` file with:

```bash
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=abcd efgh ijkl mnop  # Your 16-character app password
FROM_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com    # Must match the whitelisted email
KINDLE_EMAIL=yourname_123@kindle.com  # Your Kindle email from Step 2
```

### 3. Start the Server

**Option A: Using the convenience script (recommended)**

```bash
./scripts/start-http-server.sh
```

**Option B: Direct command**

```bash
./annas-mcp http --port 8080
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:8080`

### 4. Connect Your MCP Client

#### For Mistral Le Chat

See [docs/LE_CHAT_SETUP.md](docs/LE_CHAT_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions.

Quick setup:
1. Open Le Chat → Intelligence → Connectors
2. Add Custom MCP Connector
3. Set **Connector Server** to: `http://localhost:8080/mcp`
4. Set **Authentication Method** to "None" (or "API Token" if required)
5. Click Create

#### For Claude Desktop

Add to your MCP configuration file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "annas-mcp": {
      "command": "/path/to/annas-mcp",
      "args": ["mcp"],
      "env": {
        "ANNAS_SECRET_KEY": "your-api-key",
        "ANNAS_DOWNLOAD_PATH": "/path/to/downloads"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage

### As an HTTP Server

The server exposes these endpoints:

- `GET /` - Server info and discovery
- `GET /mcp` - MCP protocol discovery
- `POST /mcp` - MCP protocol endpoint (JSON-RPC 2.0)
  - `initialize` - Initialize MCP connection
  - `ping` - Health check
  - `tools/list` - List available tools
  - `tools/call` - Execute a tool (search or download)
- `POST /search` - Direct search endpoint (legacy)
- `POST /download` - Direct download endpoint (legacy)

### As a CLI Tool

```bash
# Search for books
./annas-mcp search "python programming"

# Download a book
./annas-mcp download <hash> <filename>
```
